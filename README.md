# ACME-Bank

This is a HTML, CSS and Javascript banking site with a functional machine learning chatbot. This project was part of a competition for the Deutsche Bank International 24 hour Hackathon competing against other employees of Deutsche Bank.

The Hackathon was called ‘Banking on AI for Accessibility.’ 

We had to develop a solution that will influence Deutsche Bank's culture and nurture an inclusive and supportive workplace for people with episodic or long-term physical disability, or mental health lived experience, and a champion for wellbeing and neurodiversity. 

We had to create a functioning prototype built on the Google Cloud Platform. The prototype had to demonstrate a good use of AI and have security controls embedded in the build

Our team project was targetted at blind people who are unable to use the bank's website. The chatbot takes in voice commands and generates an answer accodingly.

The projects were then judged by Senior Deutsche Bank employees and members from Google!
